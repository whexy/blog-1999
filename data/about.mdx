Hi, my name is Shi Wenxuan (石文轩). I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in computer science at the Southern University of Science and Technology. Currently, I am a member of the _COMPASS_ lab supervised by Professor Fengwei Zhang. I was a visiting student at the _CURIOSITY_ lab supervised by Professor Zhenkai Liang.

My research interests mainly falls on **system security** including hardware-assisted security, program analysis, and trustworthy execution. I am also a big fan of network protocols, IoT/Cloud/Mobile systems and programming language.

<HeadWithIcon title="Interests & Aspirations" icon="😄" />

In the next five years, I would like to pursue a PhD and focus on security, doing valuable security research, and building truly **practical** security systems.

I started coding since my primary school and I always love exploring the computer world. I got several awards in Programming Contest, such as NOIP and ICPC. Besides, I am fond with designing and developing useful applications (like this blog system), which I wrote many [posts](/) about.
