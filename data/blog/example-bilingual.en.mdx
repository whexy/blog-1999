# Building a Bilingual Blog with Next.js

This post demonstrates our new bilingual blog system built with Next.js App Router, maintaining full server-side rendering while supporting multiple languages.

## Architecture Overview

Our system uses:
- **URL-based routing**: `/en/posts/[slug]` and `/zh/posts/[slug]`
- **Server-side rendering**: All components remain as server components
- **File-based language detection**: Posts named `post.en.mdx` and `post.zh.mdx`
- **Automatic fallbacks**: Shows available language if requested language doesn't exist

## Benefits

1. **SEO Optimized**: Each language gets its own URL
2. **Server-Side Rendered**: Fast initial page loads
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript
4. **Clean URLs**: Language is part of the URL structure

This approach maintains Next.js performance benefits while providing seamless bilingual support.

## Code Example

```typescript
// Server component - no client-side JavaScript needed
export default async function Post({ params }: PageProps) {
  const { lang, slug } = await params;
  const post = getBlogPost(slug, lang);
  
  // Server-side MDX compilation
  const compiled = await compile(post.content, options);
  const { default: MDXContent } = await run(compiled, runtime);
  
  return <MDXContent components={components} />;
}
```
