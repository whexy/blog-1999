I’m watching Jon Gjengset’s live coding stream. And the topic is “Subtyping and Variance”. This is my note.


[Jon Gjengset’s live coding stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--wzpkTuCrA&feature=push-lsb&attr_tag=ivAldDGwbw3k1GZn%3A6)

## Lifetime shrinking

The Rust compiler will automatically shrink the lifetime of the parameter to the shortest one.
For example,
```rust
fn main() {
	let s = String::new();
	let x = "static str"; // `x` is `&'static str`
	let mut y = &*s; // `y` is `&'s str`
	y = x;
	// Still compilable!
  // Rust automatically shrink the lifetime static to s.
}
```
That makes sense, because you can always trust a value from who lives longer, without concerning about the value somehow goes invalid. What’s behind the scene is that Rust have a system of subtyping and variance.
## Subtype
Just think of an example in Java, class `Cat` is a subtype of the class `Animal`.
In brief, we say `T` is a subtype of `U` (notation `T <: U`) when `T` is at least as useful as `U`. `T` can do anything that `U` can do, but `T` may have the ability of other things.
In Rust, the lifetime `’static` is a subtype of every lifetime. Rust compiler then uses different variance rules to check whether the program should be compiled or not.
## Variance
You may understand variance in many other programming languages. And there are three types of variance in programming, called **covariance**, **contra-variance**, and **invariance**.
### Covariance
Covariance is the most common case. Most things in Rust is covariance.
For example,
```rust
/// define a function which takes an lifetime sticker `a`
fn foo(_: &'a str) {}

// and you can call the function with
foo(&'a str);
// or
foo(&'static str);
```
In the example, we can give the function with parameter whose lifetime is no matter `a` or `static`. That is because `static` is a subtype of `a`. 
The static str lives longer than the required `’a`, so there should be no concern that the borrowed variable would be unexpectedly dropped.
### Contra-variance
Let’s consider the high-rank function example below.
```rust
/// define a function which takes a function, 
/// which takes a lifetime sticker `a`.
fn foo(bar: Fn(&'a str) -> ()) {
	bar(str);
}

let x : Fn(&'a str) -> ();
foo(x); // that makes sense.

let y : Fn(&'static str) -> ();
foo(y); // should that make sense ???
```
Should `foo(y)` be compilable?  Definitely not! Let’s say if `foo(y)` compiles, then we are actually doing things in the high-rank function like:
```rust
let baz = &*String::new(); 
// lifetime of baz is shorter than 'static
fn y(_: &'static str) {}
// an function that needs a static borrowing 
y(baz); 
// [!!] Should not compile
// because a static lifetime is required.
```
The caller gives a parameter with limited lifetime. But the function we get requires a static lifetime parameter. That cannot be allowed.
However, let’s consider another example:
```rust
/// define a function which takes a function, 
/// which takes a parameter with static lifetime.
fn foo(bar: Fn(&'static str) -> ()) {
	bar("Hello Whexy~");
}

let x : Fn(&'static str) -> ();
foo(x); // that makes sense.

let y : Fn(&'a str) -> ();
foo(y); // that makes sense too.
```
This example is perfect compiled. Because the function `y` requires a parameter with limited lifetime. The caller gives it a static parameter which lives longer. Again, there should be no concern that the borrowed variable would be unexpectedly dropped.
So the contra-variance is a specific rule.
`T <: U ==> Fn(U) <: Fn(T)`
### Invariance
Invariance means “no variance”. In a short word, “just pass me exact the thing I require, no tricks.”
Let’s see this example:
```rust
fn foo(s: &mut &'a str, x: &'a str) {
	*s = x;
}
let mut x = "Hello"; // x : &'static str
let z = String::new();
foo(x, &z); // foo(&'static str, &'z str)
drop(z);
println!("{}", x); // OOPS!
```
The code cannot compile, because we are going to access `x`, which points to a dropped memory area. In fact, in `&'a mut T`, `T` is invariance. However, the `'a` is covariance. It’s not hard to figure out, so I’m left this to you as an exercise.
