The Sakai system that school teachers often use to publish courseware and assignments also supports WebDAV protocol. By configuring local WebDAV services, you can easily download course resources, saving time and effort.

## Using Sakai Personal Resource Pages at SUSTech

SUSTech gives each student 1GB of Sakai space. Using WebDAV service, you can open it as a folder locally. First thing to do is change the default password.
On the [Sakai-Gateway](https://sakai.sustech.edu.cn/portal/site/!gateway) page, click "Reset Password" on the left, enter your school email (with @mail.sustech.edu.cn suffix) on the right page, then press "Send Password". Later you can receive a "Password Reset Reminder" in the WeChat official account "Southern University of Science and Technology" Sakai function page, click to enter and input the password you want to use for WebDAV.

- Can only input school email
- Email won't actually receive emails
- If you don't receive reminders in WeChat official account, please uncheck "Disable WeChat message reminders" in "Sakai" → "Profile" → "Preferences" → "WeChat Messages"

After that, in Sakai site "Resources" functions, you can see the "Upload-Download Multiple Resources" tab. Click to enter, which contains WebDAV connections for this site.

## WebDAV Connection and Usage

Taking macOS operating system as an example. Press shortcut `⌘+K` in "Finder", then input the WebDAV address shown on Sakai. In the login page that appears, input your student ID and the password you changed earlier. You can then open Sakai content as a folder.
